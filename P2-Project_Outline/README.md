### Overview

What will your app do?
The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use application to provide assistance and real-time help for users seeking assistance with at risk youth. When entering the application, the user will be asked a series of questions regarding the situation with an at risk youth and will then be provided with a specialized prevention, intervention, and resources plan based on the answers provided. 

What might users find useful about it?
Users for this application may include parents, guardians, educators, or community partners. These users are trying to find resources for children between the ages of 8 to 16 who are at risk for delinquency behavior. The project will provide these individuals with a list of resources and a place to start as they work to get the youth back on the right track. 

Where did the idea come from?
The idea for this application belongs to Centoria Roulette-Jackson, a volunteer coordinator for the Jackson County court system. She has over 15 years of experience working with the community to keep young people out of the juvenile justice system using prevention and intervention methods. We are working together on this project to get all of the knowledge out of her head and onto a scaleable platform to help as many families and children as possible with her expertise. 

More detailed Elevator Pitch:

The problem: Over a million youth come in contact with the Juvenile Justice System every year and each state spends over a billion dollars to arrest, prosecute, and provide treatment for juvenile offenders. Research has proven that if able to address risk factors associated with delinquency behavior it can reduce a youth from coming in contact with the Juvenile Justice System. Research has also proven if parents, guardians, educators and or community partners are equipped with adequate knowledge and skills that they can provide and or obtain adequate resources for early intervention and prevention. 

Solution: To create an easy to use application for parents, guardians, educators or community partners to utilize to address youth with at risk behavior for delinquency. The program application will provide real time help for users by providing a specialized prevention and intervention action plan, skill development and resources. The program provides prevention and intervention services for children between the ages of 8 to 16 who are at risk for delinquent behavior.

Imagine being a parent, guardian, educator and or community partner trying to gain assistance for an at risk youth, but having very little knowledge has to how and or uncertain of even where to turn and or begin! You at times have even lost hope!

Look no further than this program  to give you a start to get your youth back on track and help is right at your fingertips!
